<h2>Welcome to MEAN STACK Application</h2><br>
<p>
The mean stack is intended to provide a simple and fun starting point for cloud native fullstack javascript applications.
MEAN is a set of Open Source components that together, provide an end-to-end framework for building dynamic web applications; starting from the top (code running in the browser) to the bottom (database).
<br>
 The stack is made up of:<br>

MongoDB : Document database – used by your back-end application to store its data as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) documents<br>
Express (sometimes referred to as Express.js): Back-end web application framework running on top of Node.js <br>
Angular.js: Front-end web app framework; runs your JavaScript code in the user's browser, allowing your application UI to be dynamic<br>
Node.js : JavaScript runtime environment – lets you implement your application back-end in JavaScript
</p>
